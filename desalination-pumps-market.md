<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Desalination Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Pumps</li><li>Positive Displacement Pumps</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The desalination pumps market includes two main types: centrifugal pumps and positive displacement pumps. Centrifugal pumps utilize rotational energy to move water, making them ideal for high-flow applications commonly found in seawater reverse osmosis systems. Conversely, positive displacement pumps operate by trapping a fixed volume of water and displacing it, providing consistent pressure and flow, which is beneficial for processes requiring high pressure. Both types are essential for efficiently transforming seawater into freshwater in desalination facilities.</p></p>
