<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Liquid Embolic System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>6% EVOH</li><li>8% EVOH</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Liquid Embolic System market primarily features two types based on ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH) concentration: 6% EVOH and 8% EVOH. The 6% EVOH is used for less complex embolization procedures where lower viscosity and easier delivery are advantageous. In contrast, the 8% EVOH offers higher viscosity, which is beneficial for more demanding applications requiring better occlusion and stability. Both types cater to the specific needs of medical professionals in vascular and interventional procedures.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Liquid Embolic System Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Arteriovenous Malformations</li><li>Hypervascular Tumors</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Liquid Embolic System market finds significant application in treating arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and hypervascular tumors. AVMs are abnormal connections between arteries and veins, which can lead to severe complications if not managed effectively; liquid embolic agents help occlude these vessels. Hypervascular tumors, characterized by an excessive blood supply, benefit from liquid embolic agents to reduce blood flow and shrink tumors prior to surgery or as a standalone treatment. Other market applications include vascularized lesions and vascular occlusion in various interventional procedures.</p></p>
