<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Graphics Card Fans Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Axial Fans</li><li>Centrifugal Fans</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In the graphics card fan market, two primary types are prevalent: axial fans and centrifugal fans. Axial fans move air parallel to the fan's axis, offering efficient cooling in a compact design, commonly found in most GPUs. In contrast, centrifugal fans, which draw air into the center and expel it at right angles, provide higher static pressure and airflow, making them suitable for high-performance applications where dense heat dissipation is essential. Each type serves specific cooling needs in various gaming and computing scenarios.</p></p>
