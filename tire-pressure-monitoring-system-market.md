<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tire Pressure Monitoring System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct TPMS</li><li>Indirect TPMS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) market is primarily divided into two types: Direct TPMS and Indirect TPMS. Direct TPMS uses sensors mounted inside the tire to measure air pressure and provide real-time data to the vehicle's dashboard. In contrast, Indirect TPMS relies on the vehicle's ABS (Anti-lock Braking System) to estimate tire pressure based on wheel speed differences. Both systems aim to enhance safety and fuel efficiency by alerting drivers to under-inflated tires, but they differ in technology and implementation.</p></p>
