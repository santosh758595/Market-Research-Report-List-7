<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Peptide Antibiotics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ribosomal Synthesized Peptide Antibiotics</li><li>Non-Ribosomally Synthesized Peptide Antibiotics</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The peptide antibiotics market is divided into two primary types: ribosomally synthesized and non-ribosomally synthesized peptide antibiotics. Ribosomally synthesized peptide antibiotics are produced by ribosomes through the transcription and translation of genetic material, resulting in linear peptides that can exhibit antimicrobial properties. In contrast, non-ribosomally synthesized peptide antibiotics are generated by enzymes outside of ribosomes, leading to complex cyclic structures. Both types offer unique therapeutic potentials, particularly against antibiotic-resistant bacteria, driving ongoing research and development in the pharmaceutical sector.</p></p>
