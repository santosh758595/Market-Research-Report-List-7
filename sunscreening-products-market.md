<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sunscreening Products Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Chemical Sunscreen</li><li>Physical Sunscreen</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The sunscreen market is primarily divided into two types: chemical and physical sunscreens. Chemical sunscreens absorb UV radiation through synthetic compounds, transforming it into heat, which is then released from the skin. They tend to be lighter in texture and are often preferred for daily use. In contrast, physical sunscreens, also known as mineral sunscreens, contain natural minerals like zinc oxide or titanium dioxide that sit on the skin's surface, providing a barrier against UV rays. They are typically recommended for sensitive skin.</p></p>
