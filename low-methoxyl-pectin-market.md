<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Low Methoxyl Pectin Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Conventional(LMC)</li><li>Amidated（LMA)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Low Methoxyl Pectin (LMP) market is divided into two primary types: Conventional (LMC) and Amidated (LMA) pectins. Conventional LMC is derived from fruits and requires sugar for gelling, making it ideal for low-sugar applications. Amidated LMA, on the other hand, is treated with ammonia, allowing it to gel without sugar, thus enabling a broader range of applications, including dairy and savory products. Both types are utilized in food, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics for their thickening and gelling properties.</p></p>
