<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Color Fastness Tester to Rubbing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Rubbing</li><li>Dry Rubbing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Color fastness testers for rubbing are devices used to assess the resistance of textiles to color transfer through friction. The market comprises two main types: wet rubbing and dry rubbing. Wet rubbing measures color fastness under conditions where moisture is present, simulating real-life situations like washing or exposure to moisture. In contrast, dry rubbing evaluates color stability under dry conditions, assessing the potential for color transfer during normal wear. Both methods are essential for ensuring product quality in the textile industry.</p></p>
