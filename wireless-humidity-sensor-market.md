<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wireless Humidity Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Relative Humidity Sensor</li><li>Absolute Humidity Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The wireless humidity sensor market is primarily divided into two types: relative humidity sensors and absolute humidity sensors. Relative humidity sensors measure the moisture content in the air as a percentage of the maximum amount of moisture air can hold at a given temperature, providing context-dependent readings. In contrast, absolute humidity sensors measure the actual amount of water vapor in the air, expressed in grams per cubic meter, making them useful for applications requiring precise moisture levels, independent of temperature.</p></p>
